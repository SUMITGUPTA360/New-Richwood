The aim is to restore the users right of anonymity in the web. Most websites monitor the behaviour of their users, giving the websites hosts the ability to analyze the general users behaviour and create detailed user profiles, which are frequently sold to third parties.\nA threat for freedom of speech on the internet manifests in the repression through federal or private organizations. More and more governments censor websites with the excuse of child safety, copyright infringement or the fight against terrorism and thereby limit the freedom of speech.\nAlso blocking users based on their origin with GeoIP-Blocks is applied often, for example at media platforms like YouTube.\n\nanonymoX enables you to...\n\n    Browse the web anonymously\n    Change your IP address (to one provided by us)\n    Visit blocked/censored websites\n    Appear to originate from another country\n    Delete cookies, show your public ip, change browser id, ....\n\n\nShort summary of its functionality\nInstead of accessing a website directly, it will be first opened by one of our servers, called a Proxy.\nThis Proxy hides your true internet identity and makes it look as if not you, but the Proxy is currently visiting the website.\n\nanonymoX is more than just an Add-On. The actual anonymization and country faking is done by an anonymization network. It consists of many servers, in every country of your country list. These servers are provided and managed by us.\nIf you use anonymoX's anonymization network without paying, that is only possible because you indirectly participate in the server funding by viewing advertisements.\n\nFor ad-free and unrestricted usage of the anonymization network and the Add-On, you need anonymoX Premium.\n\nPlease note our Guideline for proper use, if correct functionality and anonymity is very important to you.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/103/103898.png?src=api&modified=1371554111","width":"253","height":"359","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/103/103898.png?src=api&modified=1371554111","thumbnailWidth":"106","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"The settings panel from which you can change country,  identity and others"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/103/103900.png?src=api&modified=1371554111","width":"700","height":"377","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/103/103900.png?src=api&modified=1371554111","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"108","caption":"The settings panel and a website that shows the anonymized IP-Address instead of the real one"}],"averageRating":3,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/anonymox/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://www.anonymox.net/en","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/580082/anonymox-2.5.3.1-fx.xpi?src=api","size":363943,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/anonymox/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":473,"totalDownloads":50598158,"weeklyDownloads":166066,"dailyUsers":469501,"updateDate":1485628486000,"supportURL":"http://www.anonymox.net/en/contact"},{"id":"langpack-en-GB@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":null,"64":null},"name":"English (GB) Language Pack","type":"locale","version":"53.0","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"},"description":"English (GB) Language Pack","fullDescription":null,"isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"averageRating":2,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/english-gb-language-pack/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/english-gb-language-pack/?src=api","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/633115/english_gb_language_pack-53.0-fx.xpi?src=api","size":445032,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/english-gb-language-pack/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":14,"totalDownloads":813753,"weeklyDownloads":1515,"dailyUsers":813753,"updateDate":1492609583000,"supportURL":null},{"id":"langpack-en-ZA@firefox.mozilla.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/6/6180-32.png?modified=1358351591","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/6/6180-64.png?modified=1358351591"},"name":"English (South African) Language Pack","type":"locale","version":"53.0","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Dwayne Bailey","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/dwayne-bailey/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Translate.org.za","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/translateorgza/?src=api"},{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"}],"description":"Adds South African English language support to the Firefox browser.
