I have created chainset in a sandbox .  I have no permission to deploy in production box from chainset.
I have done all changes according to requirement updated lead source 'SMS' And test classes were done.


Chaninset Name : SMSHistory1.0.
Custom field :SMS Send on Oject	Lead,	Custom Field API	SMS_Send
Apex Class Name:	SMSHistoryTriggerHandler
Apex Class Name:	SMSHistoryTriggerHandlerTest

Email Templet Name: "Incoming SMS Formet" on Custom Object Name: SMS Template
Email Templet Name: "Send text response SMS" on Custom Object Name: SMS Template

I have used email templet Id in Process builder.
Email template id used for Email templet 'Incoming SMS Format' in Custom Label: TempletId

Process builder Name :

Process Builder - Send Auto SMS for a Incoming SMS Formet 1.1.1		Flow Definition:	Send Auto SMS for a Incoming SMS Formet
