* Contact and Account records will no longer be
created/updated, and managed from the Bizzabo
application directly and instead determined by the Ticket
object details

*The account name (clean) will be used as a secondary
qualifier for matching a contact to an account record


*The website will be the third level of matching used to fian existing Account/Contact match. Additionally, a  field
will be created within the Bizzabo form (required) to house
the website

*Any non-matching contact records to be created and
associated to a default account record defined through a
custom setting

*Email domain will be used as the initial qualifier for
matching a contact to an account



Apex will be used for both existing and new account
records to update the Account Domain field with all email
domains separated by commas


A domain exception list custom setting will be created to
determine which email domains should be excluded from
the above automation



1.3

Apex will be used to determine if the matched contact is
already a campaign member

The campaign member will be created and/or updated to
the appropriate status based on the transaction made and
any check ins recorded through Bizzabo

Apex will be used to create an opportunity with contact
role(s) and products based on the details of the
transaction passed to the ticket object

There will be a default product to be used for any
undefined transactions tied to an opportunity

The purchaser and any other represented members will
be included as contact roles on the opportunity record
with the primary contact being the purchaser with a role of
purchaser. Any other represented members will be
included as contact roles with a role of registrant
